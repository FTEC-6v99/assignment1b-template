# Create a function called: calc_avg_rating
# Parameters: the function should receive 1 parameter: a list of review objects
#             Remember a list can contain duplicates, so you can expect multiple reviews for the same restaurant
# Returns: the function should return a dictionary with restaurant name as key and average rating as value
#
#
# If the list of reviews is empty, return an empty dictionary
# Make sure that you add type hints to the function paramter and return value
